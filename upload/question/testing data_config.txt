Generate 3 True/False questions at the  Evaluating and Creating level of Bloom's Taxonomy. It should focus on evaluating and creating concepts relevant to the text. 
Specify the Bloom's taxanomy level applied at the end of each question.For true/false statement, provide statement that can be answered with True or False. Title the header as $$True/False Questions$$ Do NOT include 'True or False?' in the beginning or end of the statement. Randomize between True and False as the correct answer.
IMPORTANT: Do NOT provide explanations or other options. Only include the statement text without the answer at the end.
In the $$Correct Answers$$ section, list ONLY 'True' or 'False' as the answer for each statement.
Do NOT reveal the correct answers yet

After generating, include a separate section titled '$$Correct Answers$$'. {Strictly follow this format :{ $$Questions$$ 1. Question1 ..... (Bloom's taxanomy level), 2. Question2 ..... (Bloom's taxanomy level)$$Correct Answers$$ then new line 1. must be one of =  A,B,C or D for MCQ  or True or false for True False statement ,  ,2.  ,3.  , ......
Do NOT output anything else.} Based on the following context ----> ## Impact of Learning Rate on Convergence

**1. Convergence Speed:**

- **Higher learning rates** result in faster convergence by taking larger steps during parameter updates. This leads to quicker adjustments towards the optimal solution within a limited time.
- **Lower learning rates**, conversely, lead to slower convergence with smaller steps. This approach requires more patience and finer adjustments for reaching the minimum loss function value.

**2. Overshooting:**

When learning rates are excessively high, the model may overshoot the minimum of the loss function. 
This phenomenon results in oscillations and instability within the training process.  To avoid this, careful tuning of learning rate is crucial.


## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a powerful type of deep learning model specifically designed for processing structured grid data like images. Imagine them as complex systems that autonomously learn to identify spatial relationships and patterns within the input image. 

**How CNNs Work:**
- **Automatic Feature Extraction:**  CNNs automatically learn to extract essential features from raw input data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. This automated extraction process is a significant advantage of CNNs compared to traditional machine learning models.
- **Spatial Hierarchy:** By utilizing multiple layers of convolutions, CNNs build a hierarchical structure of features starting from simple elements and progressing towards more complex ones. This hierarchical approach allows them to decipher intricate patterns within the input image.
- **Parameter Sharing:** Convolutional layers utilize the same filter (set of weights) across different parts of the input data. This sharing mechanism significantly reduces the number of parameters and, consequently, computational complexity compared to fully connected networks.
- **Translation Invariance:**  The structure of CNNs promotes robustness towards translations and shifts in the input image. Due to their inherent design, they can effectively recognize patterns regardless of their precise position within the image. 


**Benefits of CNNs:**

*  Efficiently process structured grid data like images. 
*  Automatically extract features, simplifying feature engineering for human developers. 
*  Create spatial hierarchies, leading to deeper understanding and recognition of complex patterns in images. 
*  Benefit from parameter sharing for reduced complexity compared to traditional fully connected networks.
*   Exhibit robustness against changes in input image position (translation invariance).
